- more for Oeser et al., 2017:
    • intra-annual STMs 
        ◦ regarding forest classification used similar (same?) intra-annual STMs as we do (nice results)
        ◦ regarding disturbance classification etc. used different metrics
    • forest disturbance context
    • potential of additional metrics (e. g. regarding topography [for e. g. effect of windthrow)
    • Landsat (TM, ETM+, OLI)
    • also used TCT (but maybe in special way?)
