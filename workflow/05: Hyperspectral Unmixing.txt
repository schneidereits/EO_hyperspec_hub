05: Hyperspectral Unmixing

Title: Exploring hyperspectral imagery for unmixing vegetation classes


Abstract: Terrestrial ecosystems are often highly complex, with
interactions between topography, soil composition, and climate 
creating fine-scale mosaics of vegetation cover. This leads to 
mixed pixels as spatial resolutions common in satellite imagery, 
and therefore unmixing vegetation cover is needed to fully capture 
vegetation dynamics. Imaging spectroscopy provides enhanced spectral
feature resolution, and may therefore be beneficial in 
distinguishing between relatively similar vegetation classes as 
compared to broad-band imagery. To this end, numerous narrowband 
indices have been developed to enhance the relationships with 
specific vegetation properties. In this project, you will explore
the capabilities of hyperspectral imagery for mapping vegetation 
class fractions in California. You may explore the use of
hyperspectral indices to enhance mapping efforts, and draw 
comparisons to Landsat-based analyses. You may further use the 
Landsat imagery to explore the effect of acquisition date on
model performance. 


Research Questions: 

1)	How can hyperspectral imagery or derived narrowband indices 
    be used to better map vegetation class fractions as compared 
    to multispectral imagery?

2)	Using multi-temporal multispectral imagery, explore how 
    acquisition date can influence accuracy of the regression
